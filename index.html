            <h2 class="about__role">An aspiring Fullstack Engineer/Developer</h2>
            <p class="about__desc">
                I have a passion for learning and creating new things. I have extensive experience in business settings as a previous Senior Accountant
                before transitioning into the tech industry as a Technical Business Systems Analyst. I have a Bachelors of Science in Accounting & a Masters of Science in Management Information Systems from UNLV.
                My experience in the tech industry has been in the Business Intelligence & Data Analysis space with experience in Project Management and an ongoing education in programming & coding. 
                I have always had a passion for technology in general and a desire to delve deeper into coding. I am currently enrolled in a Fullstack Web Development Community Bootcamp called #100Devs.
                Apart from some exposure to programming in college, I am self-taught and have been learning through online resources such as Udemy, Codecademy, and FreeCodeCamp and even official documentation.
                In addition, the #100Devs bootcamp has been a great resource for learning and networking with other aspiring developers. I am currently learning the MERN stack and have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and SQL.
                However, I am always looking to learn more and expand my knowledge and skillset. I am currently looking for opportunities to gain experience and grow as a developer, as well as learn more about Backend Development, more specifically in the C#/.NET space. 
                Some interests of mine include: music, health/fitness, video games, and movies. I am a huge fan of the UFC and the Video Game industry. I also am a huge fan of Fantasy & Sci-Fi
